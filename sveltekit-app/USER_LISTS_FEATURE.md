# User Lists Feature

## Overview

The User Lists feature allows authenticated users to view all their notes in one centralized location at `/lists`. This provides a convenient way to browse, search, and filter through all the characters they've added notes to.

## Features

### 1. Centralized Note View
- View all your notes in one place
- Each note displays:
  - The character
  - The note content (with Markdown rendering)
  - Last updated date

### 2. Search & Filter
- **Search**: Filter notes by character or note content
- **Sort Options**:
  - Last Updated (default)
  - Date Created
  - Character (alphabetical)

### 3. Quick Navigation
- Click any note card to navigate directly to that character's page
- Notes are displayed as clickable cards with hover effects

### 4. Empty States
- Helpful messages when:
  - User is not signed in
  - User has no notes yet
  - Search returns no results

## Implementation Details

### API Endpoint
**GET `/api/user/notes`**
- Returns all notes for the authenticated user
- Requires authentication (401 if not signed in)
- Sorted by `updatedAt` descending by default

### Route
**`/lists`** - Main page for viewing user notes

### Navigation
- Added a üìù icon button in the header (visible only when signed in)
- Links directly to `/lists`

### Components Used
- `Header.svelte` - Updated to include lists link
- New page: `src/routes/lists/+page.svelte`

### Dependencies
- `isomorphic-dompurify` - For safe Markdown rendering
- `marked` - For Markdown parsing

## User Flow

1. User signs in with Google
2. User adds notes to various characters throughout the dictionary
3. User clicks the üìù icon in the header
4. User sees all their notes in a grid layout
5. User can:
   - Search for specific notes
   - Sort by different criteria
   - Click any note to go to that character's page

## Technical Notes

### Database
- Uses existing `notes` table
- No new tables required
- Leverages the existing one-note-per-character constraint

### Security
- All notes are private to the user
- Authentication required to view
- Uses Better Auth session management

### Accessibility
- Note cards are proper `<a>` elements (not divs with click handlers)
- Keyboard navigable
- Semantic HTML structure

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:
- Export notes to CSV/JSON
- Bulk delete notes
- Tags/categories for notes
- Share notes publicly (opt-in)
- Print view for notes
- Statistics (total notes, most recent, etc.)

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `sveltekit-app/src/routes/api/user/notes/+server.ts` - API endpoint
- `sveltekit-app/src/routes/lists/+page.svelte` - Main lists page

### Modified

### Dependencies Added
