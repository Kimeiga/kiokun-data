I’m very conflicted about how to remember this as. It shows up so infrequently on it’s own that it’s not very useful to know but it shows up a lot as a radical of other kanji. 

I think is worth a shot trying to remember by its original meaning of begin.

"省","セイ, ショウ, かえり.みる, はぶ.く","government ministry, conserve, omit","少 few 目 eye =  we only have a few eyes left, we have to conserve them. 

SHOU from 少

省 has two main onyomi readings in Japanese:
1. しょう (shō):
- When meaning ""ministry/department"":
  - 省庁 (shōchō) - government ministry/agency
  - 外務省 (gaimushō) - Ministry of Foreign Affairs

- When meaning ""to save/economize"":
  - 省エネ (shōene) - energy conservation
  - 省力化 (shōryokuka) - labor saving

2. せい (sei):
- Used primarily in words related to reflection/introspection:
  - 反省 (hansei) - self-reflection
  - 省察 (seisatsu) - self-examination

So generally:
- shō (しょう) → government ministries and conservation/saving
- sei (せい) → reflection/examination

In Chinese:
省 (shěng/xǐng) has several meanings:
1. Province (shěng)
- 广东省 (Guǎngdōng shěng) - Guangdong Province
- 山东省 (Shāndōng shěng) - Shandong Province

2. To save/economize (shěng)
- 省钱 (shěng qián) - save money
- 节省 (jiéshěng) - to economize

3. To examine/reflect (xǐng)
- 反省 (fǎnxǐng) - to reflect on oneself
- 省察 (xǐngchá) - to examine carefully


Unlike Chinese, Japanese doesn't use 省 commonly as a standalone word for ""province"" - it uses 都道府県 (todōfuken) instead for administrative divisions.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Phonosemantic compound. 目 represents the meaning and 生 represents the sound. Based on the original meaning ""eye disease"", now written as 眚. The current meaning is a phonetic loan.

——

Only a select few eyes SHOW enough detail for the ministry"
"袁","エン, オン","long kimono","Long robes

土 hat, 口 head, 衣 clothes. Worn in ancient China

Wizard

Yellow bridge said that it’s a picture of a person wearing a pendant 土口 and clothes 衣. There’s also a theory that it’s pictophonetic. 

I think I’m going to call it the “wizard” because it seems easiest. I always try to come up with a way to remember things the way they are without having to do variations, but this character is kind of hard to do that with because it doesn’t really have meaning besides being Yuan, a common last name. And all the onyomis it appears in are usually En as a result. 



"
"睘","","round, stare","Well this is 袁 with an eye 目 on top of his head. 

So the only natural thing to call it is the all seeing wizard. "
"環","カン, わ","ring, circle, loop","Imagine the radical is 玉 instead of 王.

"彩る","いろどる","to colour, to color, to paint; to apply make-up; to decorate, to garnish, to adorn, to add flair","色 color + 取る in this case, give (2nd definition on shirabe)

Give color to = adorn

But usually the other kanji

"
"采","サイ, と.る, いろどり","dice, form, appearance, take, gather, coloring","爪 (“hand”) + 木 (“tree”) – a hand (爪) picking from a tree (木 (mù)). Which is why if you add a hand radical, it becomes 採 which means pick. 

This communicates “random” as you won’t know which fruit you are going to pick. Which is kind of like a die. You could also think of it as a hand dropping a wooden die on the table. 

"
"彩","サイ, いろど.る","coloring, paint, makeup","彩 (sai) is the sound. The hair indicates it is about hair, like coloring or dying your hair. This communicated that it’s coloring or makeup or adornment"
"关","","frontier pass, close, relation","关 is guan, close in Chinese"

"取り組み","とりくみ","effort, initiative, dealing with, grappling with, wrestling with; bout (in sports, etc.), match","Take up and assemble to DEAL with something"
"参","サン, シン, まい.る, まい-, まじわる, みつ","nonplussed, three (in documents), going, coming, visiting, visit, be defeated, die, be madly in love, participate, take part in","I think the definition makes more sense as ""join""

Ok so

Originally this character was 參
It’s three stars (厽) with their light (彡) reaching humans (人)

Actually it’s the name of a constellation, the Three Stars mansion, which corresponds to the belt of Orion 

That’s why it also can mean 3 in a banker’s note. 

The meaning of join comes about from how the stars are seemingly joined together in a close grouping. 

Eventually 厽 got simplified to ム with a 一 underneath

You can remember the readings (that matter) like this

I want to join MAI SAN stars in the sky (the aforementioned constellation)"
"屈","クツ, かが.む, かが.める","yield, bend, flinch, submit","My theory is that the Corpse Exited with his kutsu (shoes)

Originally bent tail 尾 + 出 (the bent tail wanting to stretch out or sprout)

Ancient books say it’s when you have to fold a body (尸) to carry it out (出) the door. Of course you have to wear KUTSU in order to do it properly. (From 出 SHUTSU)"
"失","シツ, うしな.う, う.せる","lose, error, fault, disadvantage, loss","Picture of a husband holding the side of his head with his right hand as if he made a blunder saying SHITSu"
"敗","ハイ, やぶ.れる","failure, defeat, reversal","Reading from 貝 (ばい) -> 敗（はい）

YA BOO was so mad from the defeat that she hit her shell until it broke. 

Originally meant destroy as in hit a shell until it breaks. "
"羹","コウ, カン, あつもの","hot soup","Two sheep on top of each other KAN run faster when fueled by agar jelly balls

The Japanese dessert ""Yokan"" (羊羹) is a jellied dessert made of red bean paste, agar, and sugar. Its name originates from Chinese and literally means ""sheep broth"" in English, but there isn't a clear link between the dessert and sheep.

The term ""羊羹"" was originally used in ancient China and referred to a mutton soup. Over time, it came to be used to describe a wider variety of thick, gelatinous dishes, not just those made with mutton. This term was then borrowed into Japanese, where it became associated with the bean paste dessert we know today. It's a good example of how words can change in meaning when they move between cultures and languages. 

So, the name doesn't really describe the ingredients or the process of making this dessert, but is a historical term that stuck."
"昜","ヨウ","open, sun","Ideogrammic compound (會意): 日 (“sun”) + 示 + 彡 The rays of the sun.

Memorize as: sunrays (YOU)"
"楊","ヨウ, やなぎ","willow","Sunrays tree = willow
Reading from sunrays (YOU)"
"支","シ, ささ.える, つか.える, か.う","branch, support, sustain, branch radical (no. 65)","Ideogrammic compound (會意): 又 (“hand”) + 十 (“(half of 竹) branch of bamboo”) – a hand breaking off a branch of bamboo.

The action of breaking this branch makes a SHI sound as the leaves rustle "
"枝","シ, えだ","bough, branch, twig, limb, counter for branches","The tree radical makes it even more like a tree branch"
"切符","きっぷ","ticket","Be sure to KEEP your ticket on you

The term ""切符"" in Japanese, pronounced ""kippu,"" is used to denote a ticket. The individual Kanji characters in this word have their own meanings. ""切"" means ""to cut"" and ""符"" means ""mark"" or ""symbol.""

In the past, tickets often took the form of tags or marks that were cut or torn from a larger piece, thus the use of the character for ""cut."" These cut pieces served as symbols or proof of purchase, hence the character for ""mark"" or ""symbol.""

So, together, ""切符"" can be understood as a cut mark or symbol, which accurately describes the function of a ticket. It's an example of how kanji characters can come together to form words with meanings that are greater than the sum of their parts."
"免","メン, まぬか.れる, まぬが.れる","excuse, dismissal","Pictogram of a man in a hat. Borrowed for abstract meaning. 

The MEN tips his hat to excuse himself

Remember the meaning by remembering this is goMEN’s men"
"拝","ハイ, おが.む, おろが.む","worship, adore, pray to","Hand offering crops as offering during worship like HAI yes my god"
"拝見","はいけん","seeing, looking at","Worship see as in humbly see"
"引っ越し","ひっこし","moving (dwelling, office, etc.), changing residence","Sure, the term ""引っ越し"" (hikkoshi) in Japanese, meaning ""to move,"" is composed of two kanji characters: ""引"" (hiki) and ""越"" (koshi). 

The character ""引"" (hiki) means ""pull"" or ""draw."" The character ""越"" (koshi) means ""cross over"" or ""move beyond.""

Together, ""引っ越し"" (hikkoshi) can be literally interpreted as ""pulling across"" or ""drawing across,"" which metaphorically conveys the concept of moving one's belongings from one place to another. In this way, the term aptly describes the action of changing your place of residence."
"戉","ジュウ, エツ, えびす, まさかり","warrior, arms, savage, Ainu","Battle axe"
"越","エツ, オツ, こ.す, -こ.す, -ご.し, こ.える, -ご.え","surpass, cross over, move to, exceed, Vietnam","Think of it like koş like run except it’s move to in this case.

"離","リ, はな.れる, はな.す","detach, separation, disjoin, digress","Ok so i looked it up on baike and it makes more sense now

Left side is a trap with a bird in it 离
There’s a hand on top 亠
And then the bird X
And then the handle and hand grabbing it 禸

And the bird on the right 隹 is to specify that it’s a bird, but in simplified Chinese they took it away

It means separate because you are separating the bird out of the trap with your hand. You are reLEasing it. (Li in Chinese, Ri in Japanese)



Left side is a bird 离
Right side is a bird 隹

Means to leave just like birds flying away. Two birds means REpeat

Phono-semantic compound (形聲, OC *reːls, *rel, *rels): phonetic 离 (OC *rel, *r̥ʰel) + semantic 隹 (“bird”) – black-naped oriole (Oriolus chinensis). This sense is preserved in the compound 離黃.

Phonetically borrowed for the sense ""to depart""."
"着","チャク, ジャク, き.る, き.せる, つ.く, つ.ける","don, arrive, wear, counter for suits of clothing","It seems like KI is don and CHAKU is arrive 

CHAKU: they CHAK that everyone’s seat belt is fastened before the plane lands

TSU is also arrive"
"坴","リク, ロク","clod of earth, land","圥 man on 土 land = land

This character ends up in a lot of kanjis like 熱 and others, so it might be worth memorizing it semantically even though it’s usually a phonetic

It means land, you can assume the 圥 on top is a man (technically it’s a mushroom but who cares) on the ground 土. 

It’s pronounced RIKU because that 圥 is Rick and he’s standing on the land"
"⻖","","","Usually land, or place

從眾多人員中選出的能手

Hand is often used to mean -er

Yes, you’re correct. When “手” is used as the second character in a compound noun, it often refers to a person who is engaged in a specific activity, particularly when it’s paired with a verb or an action. It’s somewhat similar to the use of “-er” or “-or” in English to indicate a person who performs a certain action.

For instance, in “畫手” (huàshǒu - painter), “書手” (shūshǒu - calligrapher), or “打手” (dǎshǒu - hitter), the “手” indicates a person who is doing the action. So in “選手” (xuǎnshǒu - athlete), the “手” suggests a person who is selected for a particular task or role, such as participating in a sports event."

Shuowen kinda butchered it into its four parts, saying that it’s a child (子) standing on an obstructed road (止) to compare (匕) the paths (矢), thereby accidentally separating the human figure on the left into 匕 and 矢. 

But if you can see, the left side is the confused person with open mouth looking at the sky, and the right part was originally 止 and 牛 as the phonetic, but 牛 was switched for 子 eventually. 

Considering it was 子 on top of 止 you can just memorize the character as an old man on the left with open mouth and a child on the right both confused and doubting

"気が回る","きがまわる","to be attentive to small details; to be attentive to others (or others' concerns); to have one's mind turn groundlessly to something negative","Literally mind turns around

The phrase ""気が回る"" (ki ga mawaru) is a commonly used expression in Japanese, which can be translated literally as ""mind turns around"" or more naturally as ""to pay attention"" or ""to be considerate"". The idea behind this expression comes from the notion of one's mind or attention (気, ki) being able to circulate or cover different aspects or details (回る, mawaru).

The origin of this phrase is not particularly noted in historical texts or literature. Like many idiomatic expressions, it likely developed organically over time as a way to describe the concept of being mindful or attentive to various things.

Please note that in the negative form ""気が回らない"" (ki ga mawaranai), it implies that someone is not being able to pay attention to various things or overlooks details, often due to being preoccupied, overwhelmed, or not considerate enough."

So you could imagine, you committed a crime, now nine generations of your family have each become A DAngerous enemy. 

KYUU from 九

The concept of ""nine"" associated with hatred in the character ""仇"" (chóu) might have stemmed from ancient Chinese legal principles and societal norms. According to a system known as ""lianzuo"" or ""collective punishment,"" when one person committed a crime, their entire clan or family group could be punished as well. This sometimes extended to nine generations or nine degrees of kinship, hence the reference to the number nine.

In this way, the character ""仇"" could be seen to represent the potential repercussions of this system: the deep resentment or enmity that can develop when innocent family members are punished for the crimes of one individual. This is just one possible interpretation, as the exact origins of Chinese characters and their associated meanings can be complex and multi-faceted, shaped by centuries of linguistic, cultural, and societal evolution."

""なかった (nakatta)"" is the past tense of ""ない (nai)"", which means ""not"" or ""does not exist"".
""こと (koto)"" is a nominalizer, which can turn a verb or a sentence into a noun phrase.
""にする (ni suru)"" is a verb phrase that means ""to decide on"" or ""to make it"".

But both 应 and 応 look pretty different from traditional 應

Can memorize as a protected heart is likely to respond with acceptance. Like OUh, of course!

The Chinese character ""應"" (yīng, yìng) is a common standard level one Chinese character. The general accepted original meaning is ""as it should be"", used as an auxiliary verb, pronounced as yīng. The character is derived from the character for ""eagle"" (䧹) in Western Zhou dynasty gold inscriptions, and in the Warring States period, the character ""心"" (heart) was added to differentiate it into ""應"". The character can also be pronounced as yìng, referring to a response caused by related things, and by extension, it means to accept, agree, accompany, or answer. It also refers to how one treats or responds to something.

The character was originally used to represent the sound of agreement, which is an abstract concept and difficult to depict with a pictographic character. The ancient sound of the character ""䧹"" was close to the sound people made when agreeing, much like the modern Chinese character ""嗯"". Over time, the meaning of the character ""䧹"" evolved to mean to answer, to allow, to permit, and so a ""心"" (heart) radical was added to indicate the state of the heart/mind. During the Warring States period, the top left component was mistaken for ""疒"". Because ""疒"" looks similar to ""广"", in Han dynasty clerical script and regular script, ""疒"" was written as ""广"". The traditional character is written as in the figure 8. When modern Chinese characters were simplified, they were simplified according to the cursive writing style of the figure 8 character to become ""應"".

The character ""應"" (response, agreement) can also be used to denote the concept of responding to or dealing with a question or situation. This has been extended to mean ""adaptation"" or ""coping"", such as in ""應時"" (responding to the times) and ""應用"" (application, adapting to needs). Since one should answer when asked a question, ""應"" is also extended to mean ""should"" or ""ought to"", and when used in this sense, it is pronounced as yīng."

Looks similar to arrow 矢 after all

Unimportant:

There’s a Japanese kanji learning site that tried to explain it as a hand gouging something out with a コ, and that the true definition is gouging, but it was hard for me to believe so I’m just going to gloss over that.

"放し","はなし, ぱなし","leaving (on, open, unfinished, etc.); (doing) continuously, constantly, keep ...-ing","The term ""っぱなし"" (panashi) in Japanese comes from the verb ""放す"" (hanasu), which means ""to release"" or ""to let go."" The construction ""っぱなし"" is used to express the idea of leaving something in a particular state, without making any change to it. It emphasizes a continuous or unaltered state of something.

Here's an example of how it might be used:

ドアを開けっぱなしにしていた (Doa wo akeppanashi ni shite ita): I left the door open (and it stayed that way).
The ""っぱなし"" form gives the sense that the action was done and left that way, perhaps carelessly or intentionally, depending on the context."
"一泡吹かせる","ひとあわふかせる","to give someone a surprise, to catch off guard and fluster, to frustrate (e.g. someone's plans), to give someone a blow, to scare the hell out of","The phrase ""一泡吹かせる"" (ひとあわふかせる, hitoawa fukaseru) in Japanese means to ""give someone a shock"" or ""take someone down a peg."" It's an idiomatic expression, and here's a breakdown of its parts:

""一"" (ひと, hito): one
""泡"" (あわ, awa): bubble, foam
""吹かせる"" (ふかせる, fukaseru): causative form of ""吹く"" (ふく, fuku), meaning ""to blow""
The literal translation might be something like ""to make someone blow a bubble,"" but it doesn't make much sense in English. The origin of this phrase is not entirely clear, but it may be related to the imagery of someone being so shocked or taken aback that they might ""blow a bubble"" (e.g., spit or foam at the mouth).

In usage, it's a colorful way to say that you're going to shock or surprise someone, perhaps by outsmarting them or showing them up. It's often used in contexts where someone intends to get back at another person or teach them a lesson."

"思いつく","おもいつく","to think of, to hit upon, to come into one's mind, to be struck with an idea; to remember, to recall","The Japanese expression ""思いつく"" (omoi tsuku) means ""to think of"" or ""to come up with."" Here's a breakdown of its components:

""思う"" (omou): to think
""つく"" (tsuku): to attach or to adhere
The verb ""つく"" in this context is used to mean that a thought has come and ""attached itself"" to you, or in other words, has occurred to you. It can also imply the sense of arriving at an idea or coming up with a solution.

In usage, ""思いつく"" might be used when you suddenly think of an idea, remember something you had forgotten, or find a solution to a problem. It can be a spontaneous or unexpected thought, something like the English expression ""to come to mind.""

The term emphasizes the process of arriving at the thought rather than the thought itself, so it's more akin to saying ""to think of"" or ""to hit upon"" rather than simply ""to think."""

3. **居 (kyo, ko)**: This character means ""reside"" or ""to be (in a place),"" and it combines ""尸"" (body) with ""老"" (old). It can be interpreted as where one's body resides or stays.

4. **届 (todoke)**: Meaning ""deliver"" or ""reach,"" this kanji combines ""尸"" (body) with ""由"" (reason/cause). It implies something reaching its destination, possibly relating to the movement of the body.

5. **屎 (fun)**: This character specifically means ""feces"" or ""excrement,"" combining ""尸"" (body) with ""米"" (rice). It's a more direct reference to a bodily function.

"前貼り","まえばり, まえバリ","covering private parts (esp. actors during filming); minimal bikini bottom (held only by tiny straps or adhesive tape); lined hakama that bulge in the front","連濁 hari -> bari

The term **前貼り (まえばり, maebari)** comes from the Japanese adult entertainment industry and refers to a small piece of fabric or adhesive material that is applied to cover the genitals during filming or performances, especially in contexts where full nudity is either not allowed or not desired. 

Breaking down the word:
- **前 (まえ, mae)** means ""front.""
- **貼り (はり, hari)** comes from the verb **貼る (はる, haru)**, which means ""to stick"" or ""to apply.""

So, **前貼り** literally translates to ""front stick"" or ""front application,"" referring to something that is stuck to or applied to the front of the body to cover private areas."
"連濁","れんだく","rendaku, sequential voicing, in Japanese, an unvoiced sound becoming voiced when it is the initial consonant of the non-initial portion of a compound or prefixed word","**連濁 (れんだく, rendaku)** is a linguistic term in Japanese that refers to a phenomenon where the initial consonant of the second element in a compound word becomes voiced. The word itself is composed of two parts:

- **連 (れん, ren)** means ""connected"" or ""consecutive.""
- **濁 (だく, daku)** means ""voiced"" or ""muddy"" (referring to voiced sounds in linguistics).

So, **連濁** can be literally translated as ""consecutive voicing"" or ""connected voicing."" It describes the process where, in a compound word, the initial unvoiced consonant of the second word changes to its voiced counterpart. For example, in the compound word **手紙 (てがみ, tegami)**, which means ""letter,"" the word **紙 (かみ, kami)** undergoes rendaku, turning the initial **k** sound into a **g** sound when combined with **手 (て, te)**. 

This term captures the idea that when words are ""connected"" (連), a ""voicing"" (濁) change often occurs."

From this basic meaning arose the sense of finely dividing an object or leaving a shape as if sculpted. In other words, both the act of actually making incisions or patterns with a blade and the metaphorical expression of “dividing” or “engraving” the flow of time or rhythm are based on the common concept of “dividing precisely” or “making marks at regular intervals.”

	Moreover, the kanji “刻” is a phono-semantic compound originally formed by combining the element for “blade,” and it inherently carries the meaning of cutting or carving. Therefore, usages such as “engraving time” or “engraving a rhythm” are thought to have naturally developed from the image of continuously and regularly engraving something.

	In this way, because both the physical act of cutting or carving and the abstract act of dividing the flow of time or rhythm essentially refer to the same action of “dividing precisely,” the single word came to encompass both meanings."

調 / 调 — From “Harmony” to “Transfer” and “Tone”

The character 調 (simplified 调) first appears in seal script and was explained in Shuōwén Jiězì as:

「調，和也。从言，周聲。」
“調 means harmony; composed of 言 (‘speech’) and the phonetic 周 (‘complete, encompassing’).”

Its original sense was “to bring things into harmony or agreement through speech.” The semantic component 言 reflects negotiation, communication, or coordination, while 周 supplied the sound and evoked completeness or balance. Thus, 調 originally referred to the act of harmonizing or mediating differences, whether between people, sounds, or ideas.

From this central notion of harmonious adjustment, two distinct semantic and phonetic branches emerged in later Chinese:
	1.	tiáo (调) — to adjust, to tune, to coordinate internally.
	•	Used for fine-tuning or balancing elements within a system: 调味 “season”, 调整 “adjust”, 调和 “harmonize.”
	•	This branch preserved the sense of internal harmony, where elements are mixed or aligned to achieve balance.
	2.	diào (调) — to transfer, to dispatch, to tone, to key, to accent.
	•	Evolved metaphorically to describe external movement or modulation: 调职 “transfer post”, 调兵 “dispatch troops”, 声调 “tone”, C调 “key of C.”
	•	The same idea of “bringing into alignment” was extended to organizational movement (reassigning people) and acoustic adjustment (pitch, musical key, speech accent).

In essence, all modern meanings of 调 / 調 — from 调动 (transfer) to 语调 (intonation) — stem from the ancient idea of achieving harmony through adjustment. The divergence into tiáo and diào reflects a tonal and contextual specialization that developed as Chinese phonology and administrative vocabulary evolved over centuries, but both remain rooted in the shared metaphor of coordinating parts toward balance.
