Over time, it came to be used to describe a wider variety of thick, gelatinous dishes, not just those made with mutton. This term was then borrowed into Japanese, where it became associated with the bean paste dessert we know today. It's a good example of how words can change in meaning when they move between cultures and languages. \n\nSo, the name doesn't really describe the ingredients or the process of making this dessert, but is a historical term that stuck."

When “手” is used as the second character in a compound noun, it often refers to a person who is engaged in a specific activity, particularly when it’s paired with a verb or an action. It’s somewhat similar to the use of “-er” or “-or” in English to indicate a person who performs a certain action.\n\nFor instance, in “畫手” (huàshǒu - painter), “書手” (shūshǒu - calligrapher), or “打手” (dǎshǒu - hitter), the “手” indicates a person who is doing the action. So in “選手” (xuǎnshǒu - athlete), the “手” suggests a person who is selected for a particular task or role, such as participating in a sports event."

    "note": "应该的应\n\nBut both 应 and 応 look pretty different from traditional 應\n\nCan memorize as a protected heart is likely to respond with acceptance. Like OUh, of course!\n\nThe Chinese character \"應\" (yīng, yìng) is a common standard level one Chinese character. The general accepted original meaning is \"as it should be\", used as an auxiliary verb, pronounced as yīng. The character is derived from the character for \"eagle\" (䧹) in Western Zhou dynasty gold inscriptions, and in the Warring States period, the character \"心\" (heart) was added to differentiate it into \"應\". The character can also be pronounced as yìng, referring to a response caused by related things, and by extension, it means to accept, agree, accompany, or answer. It also refers to how one treats or responds to something.\n\nThe character was originally used to represent the sound of agreement, which is an abstract concept and difficult to depict with a pictographic character. The ancient sound of the character \"䧹\" was close to the sound people made when agreeing, much like the modern Chinese character \"嗯\". Over time, the meaning of the character \"䧹\" evolved to mean to answer, to allow, to permit, and so a \"心\" (heart) radical was added to indicate the state of the heart/mind. During the Warring States period, the top left component was mistaken for \"疒\". Because \"疒\" looks similar to \"广\", in Han dynasty clerical script and regular script, \"疒\" was written as \"广\". The traditional character is written as in the figure 8. When modern Chinese characters were simplified, they were simplified according to the cursive writing style of the figure 8 character to become \"應\".\n\nThe character \"應\" (response, agreement) can also be used to denote the concept of responding to or dealing with a question or situation. This has been extended to mean \"adaptation\" or \"coping\", such as in \"應時\" (responding to the times) and \"應用\" (application, adapting to needs). Since one should answer when asked a question, \"應\" is also extended to mean \"should\" or \"ought to\", and when used in this sense, it is pronounced as yīng."

It refers to the tail of an animal, an extension of the body.\n\n3. **居 (kyo, ko)**: This character means \"reside\" or \"to be (in a place),\" and it combines \"尸\" (body) with \"老\" (old). It can be interpreted as where one's body resides or stays.\n\n4. **届 (todoke)**: Meaning \"deliver\" or \"reach,\" this kanji combines \"尸\" (body) with \"由\" (reason/cause). It implies something reaching its destination, possibly relating to the movement of the body.\n\n5. **屎 (fun)**: This character specifically means \"feces\" or \"excrement,\" combining \"尸\" (body) with \"米\" (rice).

For example, in the compound word **手紙 (てがみ, tegami)**, which means \"letter,\" the word **紙 (かみ, kami)** undergoes rendaku, turning the initial **k** sound into a **g** sound when combined with **手 (て, te)**. \n\nThis term captures the idea that when words are \"connected\" (連), a \"voicing\" (濁) change often occurs."

    "note": "The word “kizamu” originally derives from the physical act of cutting something with a blade. From this basic meaning arose the sense of finely dividing an object or leaving a shape as if sculpted. In other words, both the act of actually making incisions or patterns with a blade and the metaphorical expression of “dividing” or “engraving” the flow of time or rhythm are based on the common concept of “dividing precisely” or “making marks at regular intervals.”\n\n\tMoreover, the kanji “刻” is a phono-semantic compound originally formed by combining the element for “blade,” and it inherently carries the meaning of cutting or carving. Therefore, usages such as “engraving time” or “engraving a rhythm” are thought to have naturally developed from the image of continuously and regularly engraving something.\n\n\tIn this way, because both the physical act of cutting or carving and the abstract act of dividing the flow of time or rhythm essentially refer to the same action of “dividing precisely,” the single word came to encompass both meanings."

    "note": "Diao transfer in Chinese\n\n\n\n調 / 调 — From “Harmony” to “Transfer” and “Tone”\n\nThe character 調 (simplified 调) first appears in seal script and was explained in Shuōwén Jiězì as:\n\n「調，和也。从言，周聲。」\n“調 means harmony; composed of 言 (‘speech’) and the phonetic 周 (‘complete, encompassing’).”\n\nIts original sense was “to bring things into harmony or agreement through speech.” The semantic component 言 reflects negotiation, communication, or coordination, while 周 supplied the sound and evoked completeness or balance. Thus, 調 originally referred to the act of harmonizing or mediating differences, whether between people, sounds, or ideas.\n\nFrom this central notion of harmonious adjustment, two distinct semantic and phonetic branches emerged in later Chinese:\n\t1.\ttiáo (调) — to adjust, to tune, to coordinate internally.\n\t•\tUsed for fine-tuning or balancing elements within a system: 调味 “season”, 调整 “adjust”, 调和 “harmonize.”\n\t•\tThis branch preserved the sense of internal harmony, where elements are mixed or aligned to achieve balance.\n\t2.\tdiào (调) — to transfer, to dispatch, to tone, to key, to accent.\n\t•\tEvolved metaphorically to describe external movement or modulation: 调职 “transfer post”, 调兵 “dispatch troops”, 声调 “tone”, C调 “key of C.”\n\t•\tThe same idea of “bringing into alignment” was extended to organizational movement (reassigning people) and acoustic adjustment (pitch, musical key, speech accent).\n\nIn essence, all modern meanings of 调 / 調 — from 调动 (transfer) to 语调 (intonation) — stem from the ancient idea of achieving harmony through adjustment. The divergence into tiáo and diào reflects a tonal and contextual specialization that developed as Chinese phonology and administrative vocabulary evolved over centuries, but both remain rooted in the shared metaphor of coordinating parts toward balance."
